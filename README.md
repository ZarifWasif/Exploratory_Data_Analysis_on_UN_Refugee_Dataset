# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_on_UN_Refugee_Dataset

An exploratory data analysis was conducted on UN Refugee Dataset from 1951-2023 time frame.

Open source data was taken from Kaggle, cleaned and augmented and multiple machine learning regression models were trained to cross evaluate the performance of the models.

The list of the Regression algorithms include:

**Linear Regression:** Simple and interpretable. Assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable.

**Ridge Regression:** Extension of linear regression that adds regularization to the cost function. Helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.

Another extension of linear regression with regularization. Performs feature selection by forcing some coefficients to zero.

**ElasticNet Regression:** Combines both Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques. Offers a balance between Ridge and Lasso, providing both feature selection and regularization.

**Decision Tree:** Non-linear regression algorithm. Can capture complex relationships between features and the target variable.

**Random Forest Number:** Ensemble learning method based on decision trees. More robust than a single decision tree and less prone to overfitting.

**Gradient Boosting Method:** Ensemble learning method that builds trees sequentially. Each new tree corrects errors made by the previous one.

**Support Vector Regression(SVR):** Regression extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Can capture non-linear relationships by using different kernels.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Non-parametric method that predicts the target value based on the average of its nearest neighbors.

**Neural Network Regression:** Deep learning approach that can capture complex patterns in the data. Requires more data and computational resources compared to other algorithms.
